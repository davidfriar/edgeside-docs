title: A Parameterised REST Query (From URL Segments)
description: We execute a REST query that takes parameters, in this case to a service
  which provides time data for a time zone. Our query requests data about a time zone, with the country
  region and place taken from URL segments. We dump the output to the screen using the [Debug](/elements/debug)
  element. Note that in order to support responding to multiple URLs from a single HTML page, we will
  also need to use [URL Rewriting](/urlrewriting).
