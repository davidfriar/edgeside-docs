title: Show Alternative Content
description: Here we use data about the HTTP request, from the
  [Request Data](/elements/request-data) element. We want to display different
  content depending on the country that the request has come from. We use two
  conditional elements to wrap our two different fragments of content. Note here
  that the two conditional elements show two alternative ways to use the quote character
  in an attribute. We accept the literal ' character, as in the second
  conditional element here, but some platforms may prefer to output the more technically
  correct html entity reference **&#39;**, as in the first, which we will decode.
