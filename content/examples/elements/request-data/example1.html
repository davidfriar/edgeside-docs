title: Use Request Data
description: We use the Request Data element to ask for information gathered from the user's
  HTTP request.
  We dump the output to the screen using the [Debug](/elements/debug) element.
  *Note that the information available can vary depending on the environment the
  edgeside code is running in. (In wrangler preview for example, be aware that cloudflare
  information will not be available.)*
