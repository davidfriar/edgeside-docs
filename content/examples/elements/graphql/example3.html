title: A Parameterised GraphQL Query (From URL Segment)
description: We execute a GraphQL query that takes a parameter, in this case to a service
  which provides geographical data. Our query requests data about a country, with the country
  code taken from a segment of the URL. We dump the output to the screen using the [Debug](/elements/debug)
  element. Note that in order to support responding to multiple URLs from a single HTML page, we will
  also need to use [URL Rewriting](/urlrewriting).
