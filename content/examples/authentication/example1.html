title: A Parameterised REST Query (From Request Params)
description: We execute a REST query that takes parameters, in this case to a service
  which provides time data for a time zone. Our query requests data about a time zone, with the country
  region and place taken from request parameters. We dump the output to the screen using the [Debug](/elements/debug)
  element.
