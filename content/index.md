## Welcome to EdgeSide Docs

This is the documentation site for EdgeSide, a framework for edge-side integration.

### What is EdgeSide for?

EdgeSide provides a way for websites to integrate dynamic data from external services (think of a rich, content-managed eCommerce site, for example, which needs to pull in rapidly changing product data). The data is rendered and injected into the page at 'the edge', in other words no runtime processing takes place at your origin server nor in the site visitor's browser. At the origin, your site can be entirely static (perhaps generated by a static site generator, or delivered as completely cacheable pages from a traditional CMS). In the browser, there's no dependency on any JavaScript, you'll never expose any of the secret keys you might need to connect to external services and your page arrives at the browser fully rendered, keeping search engines happy and delivering very fast page load times.

### What do you mean by 'the edge'?

When we talk about running at 'the edge', we mean that the processing takes place at the globally distributed 'points of presence' of a Content Delivery Network (CDN). For many integration use cases this is a sweet spot. We can independently cache the elements that make up our pages and deliver them to visitors with very low latency, wherever they are in the world. In the case of EdgeSide, at least for now, we're dedicated to the amazing Cloudflare CDN. Couldflare provides an awesome platform for edge-side processing called Cloudflare Workers.

### So why wouldn't I just write my own Cloudflare Worker for my site?
